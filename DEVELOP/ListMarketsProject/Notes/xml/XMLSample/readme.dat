Readme for f:\library\develop\xml\xmlsample

This directory contains source code and a ZIP file pulled from
Sunbelts' webboard.

The examples use the Document Object Model (DOM) to traverse
through the inherent tree of an XML file.

Variations of these files exist in f:\library\develop\xml.  These
are named and commented more descriptively, using "DOM" as part
of their file names.

This directory is, therefore, strictly referential

!!!Please refer to plbxml.rfm for specifics on how to run these files!!!
