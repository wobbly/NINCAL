This folder contains prototypes for logic added to nord002l.pls regarding
the formatting of .DCX files using PRTPAGE.  Initial thought was to delete
faxtester.pls and faxtester.plf and save only the second versions of these,
however, I believe the first version is the one which will rifle through the
pages correctly.

The third copies, faxtester3.pls & faxtester3.plf, use a new
option with Picture objects that pulls total page numbers of the object.
This logic replaces kludgey logic which trapped for Object errors to 
determine when page number had been exhausted.
